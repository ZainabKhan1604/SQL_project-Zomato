Project Introduction: Zomato Analytics

Welcome to the Zomato Analytics project, a comprehensive SQL-based exploration of a food service provider app inspired by Zomato. In this project, I've designed a relational database comprising four key tables - Users, GoldUsers, Sales, and Products - to capture and analyze essential data for enhancing business insights.

# Table Descriptions:

  - Users Table: This table houses user details, including userid and their signup_date.

  - GoldUsers Table: Focused on users who have availed the gold membership, this table records userid and the respective gold_signup_date.

  - Sales Table: A crucial table containing transaction data with columns for userid, created_date, and product_id.

  - Products Table: Details about various menu items, including product_id, product_name, and price.

# Key Project Queries:

  - Total Amount Spent by Each Customer:  Determine the overall expenditure for every customer on Zomato.
    
  - First Product Purchased by Each Customer: Identify the initial purchase made by each customer.
 
  - Most Purchased Item on the Menu: Find the menu item with the highest frequency of purchases and quantify the number of times it was bought.
  
  - Most Popular Item for Each Customer: Identify the preferred item for each customer based on their purchase history.
  
  - Gold Membership Insights: Analyze purchasing behavior concerning the gold membership, such as the first and last items bought, total orders, and spending before 
    becoming a gold member.
  
  - Zomato Points Calculation: Implement a points system for purchases and analyze the product that has generated the most points.
  
  - Gold Member Points in the First Year: Assess the Zomato points earned by gold members in their first year, considering the 5 points for every 10 Rs spent.
  
  - Comparative Point Earnings: Determine and compare the point earnings of specific users (e.g., User 1 and User 3).
  
  - Transaction Ranking: Rank all transactions, both overall and specifically for gold and non-gold members.

This Zomato Analytics project aims to showcase not only your SQL proficiency but also your ability to derive meaningful insights from complex data structures. The queries address various aspects of user behavior, membership trends, and point generation, providing a holistic view of the application's performance. The code and results for these queries can be explored in the repository, demonstrating your skills in database management and analysis.
